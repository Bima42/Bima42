## Where I Come From
It has been a wild ride. With a background in Neurosciences, I took a sharp turn into tech thanks to [42 Lausanne School](https://42lausanne.ch/#temoignages), driven by an insatiable curiosity and a knack for problem-solving.

The school is like Hogwarts for developers—minus the magic wands, but with a lot more coding. Here's how this unique environment helped me evolve:
* At 42, I didn't just learn to code; I learned to think like an innovator, perfect for the fast-paced startup world.
* Real-world projects galore! I built everything from web apps to complex algorithms, gaining hands-on experience.
* 42's diverse projects helped me discover my passion for full-stack development and the thrill of startup life.
* Working with a community of motivated peers taught me the value of teamwork and how to collaborate effectively, even remotely and under tight deadlines.
* It encouraged out-of-the-box thinking, turning challenges into opportunities for innovation.
* The hands-on, project-based approach gave me practical skills directly applicable to the startup ecosystem.
